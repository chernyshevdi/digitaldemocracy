      "descriptionStep5": "Dear friend! Democracy is ''the power of society''; the society is the source of power. But it is as well a responsibility to exercise this right, to make own choice, to vote for those whom the society endows with this power. The responsibility to express own position so as to change living for us and our children in our country for good. The digital era provides new opportunities. Our platform allows users to form a rating of politicians through the assessment of their actions, so that on this basis they could further make an comprehensive choice. An important part of the rating is its fairness. Therefore, we will struggle in all possible ways the attempts to affect the rating. This, unfortunately, can affect respectable users as well. We accept everyone, however if an account is suspected of fraudulent activity, we will require verification. In case the verification fails, all ratings and account actions will be deleted. Hope for your understanding. Welcome to ''Digital Democracy''!"
